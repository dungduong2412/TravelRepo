## 📋 Database Verification Checklist

After each test scenario, verify in Supabase:

### Tables to Check:
- `collaborators`: New records, verified flags, status
- `merchant_details`: New records, verified flags, status
- `user_profiles`: Created on approval, role assigned, email matches
- `categories`: Used in merchant signup
- `organization_profile`: Single record, avatar stored

### Key Fields:
- `collaborators_verified` / `merchant_verified`: Should be `true` after approval
- `collaborators_status` / `merchants_status`: Should be `'active'` after approval
- `qr_code`: Generated automatically for collaborators (32 hex chars)
- `collaborators_code` / `merchant_code`: Auto-generated unique codes
- `collaborators_password` / `owner_password`: Bcrypt hashed
- `user_profiles.role`: Must match ('collaborator', 'merchant', 'admin')

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Login fails after signup
**Solution**: Check if admin approved the account. Only approved accounts can login.

### Issue: "Email not found" error on login
**Solution**: Ensure account is approved and `user_profiles` entry exists.

### Issue: QR code shows "Internal Server Error"
**Solution**: Ensure collaborator is verified. QR generation requires verified status.

### Issue: Avatar upload fails
**Solution**: Check file size (max 10MB). Ensure file is an image type.

### Issue: Dashboard shows no data
**Solution**: Check localStorage for user data. Ensure user is logged in correctly.

### Issue: Validation errors on signup
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields filled. Password must be min 6 chars.
